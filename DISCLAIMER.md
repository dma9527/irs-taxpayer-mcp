## No Professional Advice

This software ("irs-taxpayer-mcp") is provided for educational and informational purposes only. It does not constitute tax, legal, financial, or accounting advice. No attorney-client, CPA-client, enrolled agent-client, or fiduciary relationship is created by downloading, installing, or using this software.

## No Warranty

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. THE AUTHORS AND CONTRIBUTORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, OR SUITABILITY OF THE TAX CALCULATIONS, DATA, OR INFORMATION PROVIDED.

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

- Tax penalties, interest, or underpayment charges
- Incorrect tax filings or missed deductions/credits
- Financial losses resulting from reliance on calculations
- Any damages arising from errors, omissions, or outdated data

## Tax Law Changes

Tax laws, regulations, and IRS guidance change frequently. While we make reasonable efforts to keep data current, this software may not reflect the most recent legislative changes, IRS rulings, or court decisions. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025) and other legislation may have provisions not yet incorporated.

## Your Responsibility

You are solely responsible for:

- Verifying all calculations before filing any tax return
- Consulting a qualified tax professional (CPA, enrolled agent, or tax attorney) for your specific situation
- Ensuring compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local tax laws
- Making your own tax filing decisions

## Not a Substitute for Professional Advice

This software is not a substitute for professional tax preparation services. Complex tax situations — including but not limited to international income, business entities, trusts, estates, and multi-state filing — require professional guidance that this software cannot provide.

## Data Privacy

While all calculations run locally on your machine, you should not enter sensitive personal information (SSN, bank account numbers, etc.) into any AI chat interface. This software does not require or process such information.
